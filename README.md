## 👤 About Me

I am currently working at a pharmaceutical plant as a Supervisor handling production‑process efficiency. However, I have a strong passion for programming, both electronics and web‑based applications. Despite a busy work schedule, I always make time to create automation projects. These projects are sometimes for smart‑home needs or for industrial applications.
